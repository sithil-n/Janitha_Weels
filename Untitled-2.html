    <P>* Kandy is a major city in Sri Lanka located in the Central Province. 
         It was the last capital of the ancient kings' era of Sri Lanka.
        [1] The city is situated in the midst of hills in the Kandy plateau, which
         crosses an area of tropical plantations, mainly tea. Kandy is both an 
         administrative and religious city and is also the capital of the Central 
         Province. Kandy is the home of the Temple of the Tooth Relic, one of the 
         most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World 
         Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.[2] Historically the local Buddhist rulers 
         resisted Portuguese, Dutch, and British colonial expansion and occupation.</P>


            <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>* The city and the region have been known by many different names and 
         versions of those names. Some scholars suggest that the original name of
         Kandy was Katubulu Nuwara located near the present Watapuluwa. However, th
         e more popular historical name is Senkadagala or Senkadagalapura, officiall
         y Senkadagala Siriwardhana Maha Nuwara (meaning 'great city of Senkadagala o
         f growing resplendence'), generally shortened to 'Maha Nuwara'. According to 
         folklore, this name originated from one of the several possible sources. One be
         ing the city was named after a brahmin with the name Senkanda who lived in a cav
         e nearby, and another being a queen of Vikramabahu III was named Senkanda, and af
         ter a coloured stone named Senkadagala. The Kingdom of Kandy has also been known b
         y various names. The English name Kandy, which originated during the colonial era, 
         is derived from an anglicised version of the Sinhala Kanda Uda Rata (meaning the lan
         d on the mountain) or Kanda Uda Pas Rata (the five counties/countries on the mountain
         ). The Portuguese shortened this to "Candea", using the name for both the kingdom and 
         its capital. In Sinhala, Kandy is called Maha Nuwara, meaning "Great City" or "The Cap
         ital", although this is most often shortened to Nuwara.</p>
