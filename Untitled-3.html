            <h2>Founding</h2>
    <p>* Historical records suggest that Kandy was first established by the (1353-1374 AD),
        who was the monarch of the Kingdom of Gampola, north of the present city, and 
        named Senkadagalapura at the time.</p> 
           
        
             <h2>Kandyan Kingdom</h2>
    <p>* (1473-1511)  was the first king of the Kingdom of Kandy. He was a royal from the 
        Kotte Royal Bloodline and ruled Kandy as a semi-independent kingdom under the 
        Kingdom of Kotte, making it the new capital of the Kandyan Kingdom. 
        Sena Sammatha Wickramabahu was followed by his son Jayaweera Astana (1511-1551)
        and then by Karaliyadde Bandara (1551-1581) who was succeeded by his daughter 
        Dona Catherina of Kandy (1581-1581). Dona Catherina was succeeded by Rajasinha 
        I. Rajasinha I, however, preferred to rule the hill country from the Kingdom 
        of Sitawaka on the west of the island. A period of turmoil for power ended with 
        the ascent to the throne by Konappu Bandara who came to be known as 
        Vimaladharmasuriya I. Having embraced Buddhism, he consolidated his authority 
        further by bringing the tooth relic of the Buddha to Kandy from a place called 
        Delgamuwa.</p>
        
    <p>* In 1592 Kandy became the capital city of the last remaining independent kingdom 
        in the island after the coastal regions had been conquered by the Portuguese. 
        Several invasions by the Portuguese were repelled, most notably in the campaign 
        of Danture. After the Sinhaleseâ€“Portuguese War and the establishment of Dutch 
        Ceylon, attempts by the Dutch to conquer the kingdom were repelled.</p>

    <p>* The kingdom tolerated a Dutch presence on the coast of Sri Lanka, although attacks 
        were occasionally launched. The most ambitious offensive was undertaken in 1761, 
        when King Kirti Sri Rajasinha attacked and overran most of the coast, leaving only 
        the heavily fortified Negombo intact. When a Dutch retaliatory force returned to the 
        island in 1763, Kirti Sri Rajasinha abandoned the coastline and withdrew into the 
        interior. When the Dutch continued to the jungles the next year, they were constantly 
        harassed by disease, heat, lack of provisions, and Kandyan sharpshooters, who hid in 
        the jungle and inflicted heavy losses on the Dutch.</p>
        
    <p>* The Dutch launched a better-adapted force in January 1765, replacing their troops' 
        bayonets with machetes and using more practical uniforms and tactics suited to jungle 
        warfare. The Dutch were initially successful in capturing the capital, which was 
        deserted, and the Kandyans withdrew to the jungles once more, refusing to engage in 
        open battle. However, the Dutch were again worn down by constant attrition. A peace 
        treaty was signed in 1766. The Dutch remained in control of the coastal areas until 
        1796, when Great Britain took them over due to the Kew letters during the Napoleonic 
        wars. British possession of these areas was formalized with the treaty of Amiens in 
        1802. The next year the British also invaded Kandy in what became known as the First 
        Kandyan War but were repulsed.</p>

    <P>* As the capital, Kandy had become home to the relic of the tooth of the Buddha which 
        symbolizes a 4th-century tradition that used to be linked to the Sinhalese monarchy, 
        since the protector of the relic was the ruler of the land. Thus the Royal Palace and 
        the Temple of the Tooth were placed in close proximity to each other.</P>

    <P>* The last ruling dynasty of Kandy was the Nayaks. Kandy stayed independent until the 
        early 19th century.</P> 

    <P>* In the Second Kandyan War, the British launched an invasion that met no resistance 
        and reached the city on 10 February 1815. The first time Sri Lanka fully fell into 
        the hands of a foreign power was in Kandy with the signing of the Kandyan Convention 
        in 1815 at the Sri Dalada Maligawa. The king, Vikrama Rajasinha of Kandy who was of 
        South Indian ancestry faced powerful opposition from the Sinhalese chieftains and 
        sought to reduce his power. A successful coup was organized by the Sinhalese chieftains 
        in which they accepted the British crown as their new king. This ended over 2500 years 
        of Sinhalese monarchs and the line of Kandyan monarchs and Rajasinha was taken as prisoner. 
        By 2 March 1815 the island's sovereignty was under that of the British Empire. A treaty 
        known as the Kandyan Convention was signed between the British and the Radalas. The treaty 
        was not signed by the deposed King but by members of his court and other dignitaries of 
        the Kandyan Kingdom. With this treaty, Kandy recognized George III as its King and became 
        a British protectorate. The last king of the kingdom Sri Vikrama Rajasinha was captured 
        and taken as a royal prisoner by the British to Vellore Fort in southern India along with 
        all claimants to the throne. Some of the family members were also exiled to Tanjore. Their 
        erstwhile living place is still referred to as "Kandy Raja Aranmanai" on the eastern part 
        of Thanjavur town on Old Mariamman Koil Road.</P>


            <h2>Colonial Era</h2>
    <p>* During the British period in Sri Lanka, the history of Kandy and its townscape witnessed 
        a rapid and drastic change and particularly after the Uva Rebellion. Sir Lowry is noted 
        for recording in his Gazetteer "The story of English rule in the Kandyan country during 
        the rebellion of 1818 cannot be related without shame...Hardly a member of the leading 
        families remained alive...Those whom the sword and the gun had spared, cholera and small 
        pox and privations had slain by the hundreds...Others became ignorant and apathetic. Any 
        subsequent development efforts of the government for many years were only attempts begun 
        and abandoned".</p>

    <P>* In 1848 led by Gongalegoda Banda and Puran Appu saw the rebellion known as the Matale Rebellion. 
        Prior to that the city and the country had been under British rule for 32 years, during which the 
        British had expropriated the common land of the peasantry and reduced them to extreme poverty. The 
        Kandyan villagers were forced to abandon their traditional way of life and become wage-workers in 
        the abominable conditions that prevailed on these new estates and plantations that had been introduced. 
        Despite all the pressure exerted by the colonials, the Kandyans refused. This forced the British to 
        bring in hundreds of thousands of Tamil coolies from southern India.</P>

    <P>* The rebellion began on 26 July 1848 with Gongalegoda Banda, crowned as king, and Puran Appu, as prime 
        minister, and their main objective was to capture Kandy back from the British. The Matale Rebellion was 
        a peasant revolt in the hands of the Common people, the Kandyan leadership being totally wiped out after 
        the Uva Rebellion, marked the first step in a transition from the classic feudal form of anti-colonial 
        revolt to modern independence struggles. The leadership was for the first time passed from the Kandyan 
        provinces into the hands of ordinary people or non-aristocrats.</P>

    <P>* In 1944, during World War II, the South East Asia Command of the allies was moved to Kandy, where it remained 
        until the end of the war.</P>


            <h2>Contemporary Kandy</h2>
    <P>* It is the second-largest city of the island and the capital of the Central Province of modern Sri Lanka. 
        Its geographic location has made it a major transportation hub in the island: while Kandy being the gateway 
        to the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka, the city can be reached by major motorways in every direction of 
        the island. The railway line from Colombo, the seaport on the western coast runs via Kandy to the farthest 
        point of Badulla in the Central Highlands. The main roads Colombo-Kandy and Kandy-Nuwara Eliya are 
        two of the most scenic roads of Sri Lanka; Colombo-Kandy road passes through the rubber, tea plantations 
        and rice paddies, Kandy-Nuwara Eliya road cuts through paddy fields and seamless tea plantations. Both roads 
        claw their way up winding, rounding over the rings of hills. Currently, feasibility studies are afoot for 
        another highway between Colombo and Kandy via Kadawata and the scenic city of Katugastota.</P>
